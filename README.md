# SpringBoot_Self_contained_jar
This is a very basic SpringBoot maven project with self contained jar. While creating the spring boot project we have added Spring Web dependency so that we get embedded tomcat in container
We have also added a static index.html page in resource->static folder so that when we run our application on localhost:8080 then some content is displayed.
